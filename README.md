# 👋🏻 Hey there, I'm Teodor Grigor 👨🏻‍💻

## About Me
I'm a dedicated open-source enthusiast, Android engineer, video game developer, and UI/UX designer. My passion lies in crafting innovative solutions and making meaningful contributions to the open-source community.

### Current Focus
I'm deeply engaged in developing open-source libraries for Android, with a specific focus on Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). These libraries are geared towards enhancing the Android development landscape and offering valuable tools to fellow developers.

### Supporting My Endeavors
I'm actively involved in contributing to open-source projects during my free time. Sponsorship plays a pivotal role in sustaining my efforts by covering essential expenses, allowing me to allocate more time to open-source work, and ensuring the continuity of my contributions without the constraints of a full-time job.
